# Sliding Tile Puzzle based on Cordova2048
This is a sliding tile puzzle based on 2048 that will be used to visualize some puzzle-solving algorithms.

Currently implemented features:
- basic sliding tile functionality
- goal state recognition
- high score (lower number of moves is better)
- AI traversal algorithms (Bounded DFS)

Future features:
- AI traversal algorithms and their visualization (IDDFS, IDA*)
